# Genre

The genre we chose to use is **Magazine Style** with some **Slide Show** features. Our focus from the beginning was the story and how the visualization should fit together with the story, the style to tell the story came more naturally as we began to construct visualizations, analyze those and started to build a webpage. 

We chose this genre since our visualizations are overall quite detailed and the reader has the opportunity to spend time go in depth with exploring the visualizaztions. The corresponding text is also rather in depth, however using bold and emojis trying to make it more readable, such as skimming the respective webpages also should be able to give an impression on what is going on, with the opportunity to go in depth by reading and exploring the interactive plots. 

There is somewhat linearity with the story, however not completely bound, the sidebar makes it easy for the reader to jump around to the headlines that spark interest, and the pages has some introduction in the beginning such that it is not strictly nescessary to have read the other pages, however that would be the intuitive way to click around. Therefore it can be argued that it is mostly **author-driven** in regards to somewhat **linear ordering of scenes** and as there is (if the reader chooses to go in depth with the text) a lot of **messaging**. In regards to the webpage structure and (some) of the visualizations it is **reader-driven** as the reader has the opportunity to click around and explore the **interactive website** and **interactive map plots**.
