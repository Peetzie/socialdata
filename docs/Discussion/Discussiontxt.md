* Potential further work

As obesity is caused by obtaining more calories than using, therefore obesity can potentially be passed on genetically both by metabolism but also mentally by e.g. having a drive to overeat, (https://www.cdc.gov/genomics/resources/diseases/obesity/index.htm). Therefore it could be interesting to look at peoples moving patterns around the United States and maybe even globally to get a dynamic view. 

Distrust in the government could be further investigated. 

Sex aggregated data could be interesting to look into. 

Educational data could be interesting to look into.
