# Model evaluation


Below is seen the three test-states; Oklahoma, Oregon and Pennsylvania, and the color represents if the predicted label is the same as the true label. If it is a correct prediction it is labelled  <p className="sonic">True</p>and otherwise 
<p className="wd">False</p>

The majority of the test states were predicted correctly, which gives an indication of the model being of somewhat acceptable quality.
