## What is premature deaths? 

Premature death is a measure of years of potential life lost due to a death occouring before the age of 75. The main factors contributing to early life loss are:
* Cancer

As for both North - and South Dakota, Montana and Alaska these states have in common that they are all top states of where Native American Indians have household. 
According to **[This article](https://www.ajpmonline.org/article/S0749-3797(13)00082-2/pdf)** this part of the population is more prone to Type 2 - Diabetes and obesity.
