# Political orientation




A study from 2018 investigate the voting results from 2008 and 2012 in regards to political orientation and health behaviours, which implied republicans consuming more high fat, processed foods, engaged in less in-depth health information searches and also exercised less than democrates **[[13]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29940293/)**. To gain an overview of how the political beliefs in USA is distributed it is visualized using a map.

:::tip

Hover your mouse over the county to see the political distribution in the state as well as a boolean `is_obese` telling whether or not more than 33% of the county is obese. 

:::

It is a bit hard to compare a geomap with another geomap, therefore it is not directly clear how this is correlated to obesity, the comparison to this can be seen in the correlation matrix under 'Predicting obesity'. To include this parameter in our investigation was actually just a fun idea, but as it turned out to be one of the most important features in the fitted machine learning model this map was more interesting to look into oneself.
