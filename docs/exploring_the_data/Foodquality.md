# Researching food quality

The food enviroment index, FEI, is a measure of the food environment in regards to both household income :house: and proximity to healthy foods i.e. grocery stores and similar shops and the accesability to those, i.e. is it in a reasonable distance and is it affordable :money_with_wings:.  **[[8]](https://www.countyhealthrankings.org/explore-health-rankings/measures-data-sources/county-health-rankings-model/health-factors/health-behaviors/diet-exercise/food-environment-index)**.

A majority of the top FEI rankings states are located on the east side of the country, but noticably also mainly the north side of the country. This could possibly be explained by a more tempered environment with more rain for the crops thus making it easier to produce for the local consumers. This data can also be visualized geographically, and can be seen on the figure below, where a majority of the yellow (index level 9 - 10) mostly are located in the top region of the country.

This map is interactive, so you can explore it yourself! Hovering over a county will provide information about the name of the state and county and the respective Food Environment Index.

There a few *white* counties on the maps, these are counties without data and thus are not being able to be showed on the heatmap
