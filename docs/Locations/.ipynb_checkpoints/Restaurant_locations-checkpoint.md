[ ![](stat2.png) ](stat2.png)

McDonald's is by far the most popular fast food restaurant chain in the US. 

Eventhough McDonald's top the list above it was not the first fastfood restaurant, the first fast-food chain is not even in top 10. 
However many of the famous, restaurants opened in the perid of 1940(mcdonalds) to 1965(subway & dominos). 
The expansion of fastfood restaurants began with a culture change, where as seen with McDoalds' meals no longer require preperation time, shopping, doing the dishes, not even a table as the concept is; *You can eat it with your bare hands*. This leads to a trend of american meals, where over 20% of meals are eaten in cars :blue_car: **[[11]](https://web.colby.edu/st297-global18/2018/10/29/americas-fast-food-obsession/#:~:text=One%20of%20the%20main%20reasons,and%20get%20a%20full%20meal)**.

* Orange: Burger king 
* Red: Taco bell
* Green: Wendy's 
* Blue: arby's

A clear pattern emerges from the plot; the majority of fastfood restaurants are on the east-side of the Country. 


According to **[[13]](https://worldpopulationreview.com/state-rankings/east-coast-states)** the East Coast states alone account for about 36% of the United States' total population. 
Thus it is no surprice that the vast majority of fastfood restaurants are located for ease of access to the majority of the population. 

Looking at the restaurants on the West Coast, it is very clear that is within the major cities of i.e Washington that the restaurants are distributed. 
Likewise a desert state like Nevada - Las Vegas accounts for a visible distribution on the State map!
