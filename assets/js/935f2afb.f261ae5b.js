We choose 1/3 since the median of the obesity column was 34 (health[\'adultobesity% Adults with Obesity\'].median() = 34), leaving us with a somewhat dataset split into two. The new column is_obese was then introduced as a response variable and the obesity column omitted. The prediction we did was a simple Decisiontreeclassifier to quickly try and get a prediction and therefore a possible tendency in the data. Firstly the correlation heatmap is computed to check for any surprising correlations in the data:","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"}}}')}}]);
